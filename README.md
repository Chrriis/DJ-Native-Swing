DJ Native Swing
===============

The DJ Native Swing library allows an easy integration of some native components into Swing applications, and provides some native utilities to enhance Swing's APIs.

The key components are a rich web browser, a flash player, an HTML editor, a media player and a syntax highlighter, all with a Swing-like API.
